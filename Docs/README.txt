Daedalus Game Manager
Copyright 2010 (c) Mathew Bergt, Jason Buck, Ken Kelley, and Justin Weaver.


Basic Program Usage:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To compile and run the game manager, open the DaedalusGameManager solution in
Microsoft Visual Studio 2010.  Press F5 to compile and run the program. The
manager will start up and listen for new connections.  The first client to connect is player one, and the second is player 2.  Once two clients have connected to the server,
each is then assigned a player number, and the game begins.

See the Daedals Game Protocol documentation for information on how clients
interact with the server.

See the 'Start Here.doc' file for more information.
